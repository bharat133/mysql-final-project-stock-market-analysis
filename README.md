Stock market analysis is the process of evaluating and interpreting financial data to make informed investment decisions. It involves studying various market trends, economic indicators, company performance, and historical price movements to predict future stock behavior. The goal is to determine whether a stock is overvalued, undervalued, or fairly priced.

There are two primary approaches to stock market analysis: fundamental analysis and technical analysis. Fundamental analysis focuses on a company’s financial health, including revenue, earnings, assets, liabilities, and management quality. Analysts look at macroeconomic factors, industry trends, and company-specific data such as earnings reports and balance sheets to assess a stock’s intrinsic value.

Technical analysis, on the other hand, relies on historical price data and trading volume. It involves chart patterns, moving averages, and other indicators to forecast short-term and long-term market movements. Technical analysts believe that all relevant information is already reflected in a stock’s price, and by studying patterns, they can predict future price actions.
